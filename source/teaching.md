# Open Access Teaching

I make the material for all classes I teach available on github. These are released under the unrestrictive [unlicense](http://unlicense.org/), which allows end users to use the teaching material however they wish.

###Biochem and cellular physiology (B281H)

[Material](https://github.com/harmsm/bi281h-discussions)

####Course objectives

- Survey the key molecular and cellular features shared by all organisms on earth, revealing how life can be understood in physical and chemical terms.
- Begin to develop intuition and analytical tools to think about life quantitatively and molecularly.
- Introduce several key, universal systems that are shared across organisms:
  - Serine protease
  - Hemoglobin
  - Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  - Citric Acid Cycle
  - Electron transport chain
  - ATP synthase

###Scientific programming (CH410/510)

[Material](https://github.com/harmsm/pythonic-science)

#### Conceptual Goals

By the end of the course, students should understand:

- Basic python: data types, key words, control, functions and imports
- Core python extensions for scientists: scipy, numpy, and jupyter
- Strategies for dissecting problems and formulating solutions in code
- Where to go to pick up skills in the future as the need arises

#### Skill Goals

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- Write basic python programs from scratch
- Identify existing libraries for a problem and learn how to use them
- Generate arbitrarily complex custom plots
- Simulate experimental sampling
- Manipulate scientific datasets of the following types (at a basic level):

- High-throughput sequencing data
- Chemical structure data from databases such as the PDB

### Advanced Biochemistry (CH662)

[Material](https://github.com/harmsm/ch662-lectures)

####Course objectives

- Prepare PhD students to do research in molecular biology by helping them think molecularly and by introducing tools to study binding interactions.
- This will be achieved by:
  - Introducing students to controlling conceptual frameworks in biochemistry, with an emphasis on quantitative reasoning.
  - Introducing methods used to study biomolecular properties and function, with an emphasis on binding interactions.
- By the end of this course:
  - Understand the difference between microscopic and macroscopic phenomena and know the conceptual tools used by biochemists to link the two scales.
  - Be able to employ simple mathematical models to describe both the thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecluar interactions.
  - Reason about the effects of mutations on molecular structure.
  - Have a working understanding of a collection of methods used to probe molecular mechanisms, with an emphasis on those used for binding interactions.
